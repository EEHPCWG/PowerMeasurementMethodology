\chapter{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

The following sections describe how the Green500 measurement methodology was applied by different HPC sites to their respective submissions.
These real-world examples highlight site-specific adaptions to the general methodology, serving as a reference when applying the methodology at your own computing facility.
An overview of the different submission scopes is presented in \cref{tab:examples-overview}.
