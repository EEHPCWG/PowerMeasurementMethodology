\paragraph*{CSV file}
\begin{quote}
A comma-separated values (CSV) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form. A CSV file is readable by most spreadsheet programs.
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Metric}
\begin{quote}
A basis for comparison; a reference point against which other things can be evaluated; a measure.
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Methodology}
\begin{quote}
The system of methods followed in a particular discipline; a way of doing something, especially a systematic way; implies an orderly logical arrangement (usually in steps); a measurement procedure.
\end{quote}


\paragraph*{Network Time Protocol (NTP)}
\begin{quote}
Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computers.
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Power-Averaged Measurement}
\begin{quote}
A measurement taken by a device that samples the instantaneous power used by a system at some fine
time resolution (say, once per second) for a given interval (say, 10 minutes).  The power averaged
measurement for the interval is the numerical average of all the instantaneous power measurements
during that interval, and constitutes one reported measurement covering that interval.
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Sampling}
\begin{quote}
Sampling delivered electrical power in a DC context refers to a single simultaneous measurement
of the voltage and the current to determine the delivered power at that point.  The sampling
rate in this case is how often such a sample is taken and recorded internally within the device.
Sampling in an AC context requires a measurement stage, whether analog or digital, that determines
the true power delivered at that point and enters that value into a buffer where it is then used
to calculate average power over a longer time.  So ``sampled once per second'' in this context
means that the times in the buffer are averaged and recorded once per second.
\end{quote}

\paragraph*{Workload}
\begin{quote}
The application or benchmark software designed to exercise the HPC system or subsystem to
the fullest capability possible.
\end{quote}
