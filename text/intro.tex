This document recommends a methodological approach for measuring, recording, and reporting the power used by a high performance 
computer (HPC) system. The document also discusses auxiliary data, such as environmental conditions, related to 
running a workload.

This document is part of a collaborative effort between the Green500, the Top500, 
the Green Grid, and the Energy Efficient High Performance Computing Working Group.  While 
it is intended for this methodology to be generally applicable to benchmarking a variety of 
workloads, the initial focus is on High Performance LINPACK (HPL), the benchmark used by the Top500.

This document defines four aspects of a power measurement and three quality ratings. All 
four aspects have increasingly stringent requirements for higher quality levels.

The four aspects are as follows:
