\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent
This document specifies a methodology for measuring power that is used in conjunction with workload(s) to support the use of metrics that characterize the energy efficiency of high performance computing (HPC) systems as a function of both computational work accomplished and power consumed.
It reflects a convergence of ideas and a reflection of best practices that form the basis for comparing and evaluating individual systems, product lines, architectures and vendors.
